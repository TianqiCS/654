# Exploring  Better Trade-off in Private Data Generation \\ between Differential Privacy Guarantee and Generation Utility

This project is based on codes from [BorealisAI](https://github.com/BorealisAI/private-data-generation "private-data-generation") with major updates in model, dataset, loss function and additional visualization feature.

Our codes are divided in serveral sections, please check the following instructions on how to recreate our results.
